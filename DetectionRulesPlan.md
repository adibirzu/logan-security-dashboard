# OCI Detection Rules Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) security monitoring by implementing detection rules similar to those found in the [Elastic Detection Rules repository](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules). The plan focuses on creating OCI-specific detection rules that leverage audit logs and service logs to identify security threats across the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Current State Analysis

### Elastic Detection Rules Overview
The Elastic detection rules repository contains **hundreds of security detection rules** organized by:
- **Platform-specific rules**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Cloud integration rules**: AWS (69 rules), Azure (69 rules), GCP (23 rules)
- **Cross-platform rules**
- **MITRE ATT&CK taxonomy alignment**

### OCI Logging Capabilities Assessment
OCI provides comprehensive logging through:
- **Audit Logs**: Read-only logs from the Audit service
- **Service Logs**: Native OCI service logs (API Gateway, Events, Functions, Load Balancer, Object Storage, VCN Flow Logs)
- **Custom Logs**: Application and external system logs

    └── registry/           # Plugin registry
```

### 2. RESTful API Design Standards
All detection rule APIs will follow consistent RESTful standards:

**Base URL**: `/api/v1/detection-rules`

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /rules` - List all detection rules
- `GET /rules/:id` - Get specific rule details
- `POST /rules` - Create new rule
- `PUT /rules/:id` - Update existing rule
- `DELETE /rules/:id` - Delete rule
- `POST /rules/:id/enable` - Enable rule
- `POST /rules/:id/disable` - Disable rule
- `POST /rules/:id/test` - Test rule against sample data
- `GET /rules/:id/executions` - Get rule execution history
- `POST /rules/bulk/import` - Import rules from TOML
- `GET /rules/export` - Export rules to TOML

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | array,
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "version": "1.0",
    "pagination": {...}
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": {...}
  }
}
```

### 3. Zustand State Management Integration
Centralized state management for detection rules:

```typescript
// Detection Rules Store
interface DetectionRulesState {
  rules: Rule[]
  activeRules: string[]
  executionHistory: Execution[]
  alerts: Alert[]
  isLoading: boolean
  error: Error | null
  
  // Actions
  loadRules: () => Promise<void>
  createRule: (rule: Rule) => Promise<void>
  updateRule: (id: string, rule: Partial<Rule>) => Promise<void>
  deleteRule: (id: string) => Promise<void>
  toggleRule: (id: string, enabled: boolean) => Promise<void>
  testRule: (id: string, data: any) => Promise<TestResult>
}
```

### 4. Plugin Architecture for Security Features
Extensible plugin system for adding new detection capabilities:

```typescript
interface SecurityPlugin {
  id: string
  name: string
  version: string
  author: string
  
  // Lifecycle hooks
  onInstall: () => Promise<void>
  onEnable: () => Promise<void>
  onDisable: () => Promise<void>
  onUninstall: () => Promise<void>
  
  // Detection hooks
  onLogReceived?: (log: LogEntry) => Promise<void>
  onRuleMatch?: (rule: Rule, log: LogEntry) => Promise<void>
  onAlertGenerated?: (alert: Alert) => Promise<void>
  
  // Custom detection logic
  customDetectors?: Detector[]
  customActions?: Action[]
}
```

### 5. TOML Configuration and OCI Logging Analytics Integration

#### TOML to OCI Query Conversion
Implement automatic conversion from TOML rule definitions to OCI Logging Analytics queries:

```typescript
// TOML Rule Definition
const tomlRule = `
[rule]
name = "Suspicious IAM Activity"
query = '''
  event.action in ["CreateUser", "AttachUserPolicy"] and
  event.time.hour not in [8..17]
'''
`

// Converts to OCI Logging Analytics Query
const ociQuery = `
'Event Name' in ('CreateUser', 'AttachUserPolicy') and 
extract_hour(Time) not in (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17)
`
```

#### Configuration Management
Support for multiple configuration formats:
- **TOML**: Primary format for rule definitions
- **YAML**: Alternative format for complex configurations
- **JSON**: For API interactions
- **Environment Variables**: For sensitive configurations

### 6. Oracle 23ai Database Architecture

  "Find all database access anomalies in production"
]

// GenAI translates to OCI Logging Analytics queries
const ociQuery = await genAI.translateToOCI(naturalLanguageQuery)
```

  suggestNextSteps: (currentFindings: Finding[]) => Promise<InvestigationStep[]>
}
```

##### 3. AI-Enhanced Detection Rule Generation

        rule_logic = self.genai.create_detection_logic(patterns)
        
        # Optimize for performance
        optimized_rule = self.optimize_rule(rule_logic)
        
        # Generate TOML definition
        return self.to_toml(optimized_rule)
    
    def suggest_rule_improvements(self, existing_rule, false_positives):
        # Analyze false positive patterns
        fp_patterns = self.genai.analyze_false_positives(false_positives)
        
        # Suggest refinements
        refinements = self.genai.suggest_refinements(existing_rule, fp_patterns)
        
        return refinements
```

##### 4. Conversational Security Assistant
```typescript

        # Gather all security metrics
        metrics = self.gather_metrics(time_period)
        
        # Generate natural language summary
        summary = self.genai.summarize_security_posture(metrics)
        
        # Create visualizations
        charts = self.generate_charts(metrics)
        
        # Compile report
        return ExecutiveReport(summary, charts, recommendations)
    
    def generate_incident_report(self, incident_id):
        # Comprehensive incident analysis
        incident_data = self.load_incident(incident_id)
        
        # Generate detailed narrative
        narrative = self.genai.create_incident_narrative(incident_data)
        
        # Include remediation steps

### Investigating OCI Privileged Role Assumption Outside Business Hours

This rule detects when a user assumes a privileged role in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure outside of normal business hours.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the user who assumed the privileged role
- Review the user's normal working hours and patterns
- Check if this was part of scheduled maintenance
- Verify if the user was authorized to perform this action
