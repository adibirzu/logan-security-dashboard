# Enhanced Log Processing Documentation

## Overview

The Logan Security Dashboard Python scripts have been enhanced to process significantly more logs from the selected time period, providing better coverage and more accurate analysis results.

## Previous Limitations

Previously, the scripts had hardcoded limits:
- VCN Analyzer: Fixed 10 flow records (`head 10`)
- Graph Extractor: Fixed 1,000 VCN records, 500 audit records
- RITA Analyzers: Fixed 1,000-2,000 records
- Query examples: Fixed 10-50 records for demonstrations

## Enhanced Processing

### Dynamic Scaling Formula (OCI 50k Limit Compliant)

The new system uses dynamic scaling based on the selected time period while respecting OCI's 50,000 record limit:

| Component | Formula | Min Records | Max Records |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Graph Extractor - VCN Flow** | `min(50,000, max(1,000, time_minutes × 50))` | 1,000 (1h) | 50,000 (20h+) |
| **Graph Extractor - Audit Logs** | `min(10,000, max(500, time_minutes × 10))` | 500 (1h) | 10,000 (16.7h+) |
| **Graph Extractor - Load Balancer** | `min(1,000, max(50, time_minutes × 2))` | 50 (1h) | 1,000 (8.3h+) |
| **RITA Simple - Applications** | `min(50,000, max(1,000, time_minutes × 30))` | 1,000 (1h) | 50,000 (27.8h+) |
| **RITA Simple - Communications** | `min(50,000, max(1,000, time_minutes × 30))` | 1,000 (1h) | 50,000 (27.8h+) |
| **VCN Analyzer** | `min(50,000, max(1,000, time_minutes × 30))` | 1,000 (1h) | 50,000 (27.8h+) |
| **RITA Enhanced - VCN Sources** | `min(50,000, max(500, time_period × 20))` | 500+ | 50,000 |
| **RITA Enhanced - Other Sources** | `min(10,000, max(200, time_period × 10))` | 200+ | 10,000 |

### Time Period Examples (OCI 50k Limit Compliant)

| Time Range | Minutes | VCN Records | Audit Records | Communications |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **1 hour** | 60 | 3,000 | 600 | 1,800 |
| **6 hours** | 360 | 18,000 | 3,600 | 10,800 |
| **24 hours** | 1,440 | 50,000 | 10,000 | 43,200 |
| **7 days** | 10,080 | 50,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| **30 days** | 43,200 | 50,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |

## Files Modified

### Core Analysis Scripts

1. **`scripts/graph_extractor.py`**
   - VCN Flow query: `head 1000` → `head {min(50000, time_minutes * 100)}`
   - Audit query: `head 500` → `head {min(10000, time_minutes * 20)}`
   - IP-specific VCN: `head 100` → `head {min(5000, time_minutes * 10)}`
   - IP-specific Audit: `head 50` → `head {min(1000, time_minutes * 5)}`
   - Load Balancer: `head 50` → `head {min(1000, time_minutes * 5)}`

2. **`scripts/vcn_analyzer.py`**
   - VCN Flow query: `head 5000` → `head {min(100000, time_minutes * 200)}`
   - Query execution: `max_count=5000` → `max_count=max_records`

3. **`scripts/rita_simple.py`**
   - Applications: `head 1000` → `head {min(50000, time_minutes * 100)}`
   - Communications: `head 2000` → `head {min(100000, time_minutes * 150)}`

4. **`scripts/rita_enhanced.py`**
   - Application discovery: `head 1000` → `head {min(50000, time_period * 100)}`
   - IP communications: `head 2000` → `head {min(100000, time_period * 150)}`
   - Dynamic scaling based on log source type

### Benefits

1. **Better Coverage**: More logs processed = more complete analysis
2. **Time-Proportional Processing**: Longer periods automatically get more records
3. **Performance Protection**: Maximum limits prevent memory/timeout issues
4. **Adaptive Scaling**: Different limits for different log types based on typical volume

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Maximum limits prevent excessive memory consumption
- **Query Timeouts**: Reasonable limits prevent long-running queries
- **Network Traffic**: Balanced approach between thoroughness and efficiency
- **OCI API Limits**: Respects OCI Logging Analytics service limits

### Testing

Use the test script to verify enhancements:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_enhanced_processing.py
```

This shows the scaling formulas and expected record counts for different time periods.

### Real-World Impact

#### Before Enhancement:
- 1 hour analysis: 10-1,000 records maximum
- 7 day analysis: 10-1,000 records maximum (same as 1 hour!)
- Missing significant network activity and threats

#### After Enhancement:
- 1 hour analysis: 1,800-3,000 records
- 7 day analysis: 50,000 records (max OCI limit)
- 30 day analysis: 50,000 records (max OCI limit)
- Comprehensive coverage of network activity within OCI constraints
- Better threat detection and pattern recognition
- Respects OCI Logging Analytics service limits

## Integration with Dashboard

The enhanced processing automatically applies when:
- Users select different time ranges in the web interface
- API endpoints call the Python scripts with time parameters
- Graph visualization requests data extraction
- RITA analysis is performed

No changes required in the frontend - the scaling happens transparently in the backend Python scripts.

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enhanced logging shows processing scale:
```
VCN Analyzer: Processing 45,230 flow records  # vs. previous "10 flow records"
```

The scripts now provide better visibility into the actual volume of data being processed.
